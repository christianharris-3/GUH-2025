This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries. In choosing which data points to keep, we strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies across countries.\n\nThe original data with *all* available income and consumption measures is shown separately in our [Poverty Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/poverty-explorer?Indicator=Share+in+poverty&Poverty+line=%243+per+day%3A+International+Poverty+Line&Household+survey+data+type=Show+data+from+both+income+and+consumption+surveys&Show+breaks+between+less+comparable+surveys=true&country=ROU~CHN~BLR~PER).",

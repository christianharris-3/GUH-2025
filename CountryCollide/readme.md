# 🌍 Country Compare — *When Worlds Collide*

**Great Uni Hack 2025 Project**

> *Explore. Compare. Combine.*
> Discover what happens when two countries — and their worlds — collide.

---

## 🧠 Theme: *Worlds Colliding*

This year’s Great Uni Hack theme invited teams to imagine what happens when different worlds meet — across culture, data, and technology.
**Country Compare** brings that idea to life by literally colliding *countries*: combining their data, culture, and identity to create new, imagined nations.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

**Country Compare** is an interactive web platform where users can explore, compare, and creatively merge two countries.
Using real-world data, AI reasoning, and cultural context, it helps you visualize what happens when nations blend — and even plan your next trip there.

## 🗺️ Key Features

### 🌐 Interactive Globe

Built using **Globe.gl**, users can spin, zoom, and click directly on a 3D globe to select or search for any two countries.

### 📊 Country Comparison

A side-by-side, data-rich comparison of:

* Population, GDP, and land area
* Environmental impact and emissions
* Weather, climate, and geography
* Crime rates and Olympic wins

### 💡 Combine Mode

Hit **Combine Countries** to generate a new “hybrid nation”:

* Fuses key statistics
* Generates a creative, AI-written cultural profile
* Suggests the new country’s name, identity, and combined country svg outline

## 🤖 Agentic AI Integrations

### 🧳 1. Travel Agent

An **Agentic AI Travel Planner** acts as your personal guide for exploring the selected countries — or their combined hybrid version.

**Capabilities:**

* Plans detailed itineraries with suggested destinations
* Estimates **flight and accommodation costs**
* Recommends **food, activities, and local experiences**
* Uses **ElevenLabs TTS** to *speak* your travel summary aloud

> 🗣️ It’s not just data — it’s a voice that helps you plan your next adventure.

### ❤️ 2. Health & Wellbeing Report

A second **Agentic AI module** generates a *Health and Wellbeing Report* based on the countries selected.

**Features:**

* Analyzes healthcare quality, accessibility, and spending
* Compares life expectancy, happiness index, and lifestyle factors
* Highlights environmental health indicators (air quality, pollution, green space)
* Creates a **persistent, saved markdown report** — so users can revisit and track comparisons over time

> 🩺 It’s an intelligent wellness analyst that turns country-level data into human-level insights.

## 🎨 Inspiration

We asked ourselves:

> “What if you could merge two countries — their cultures, data, and people — into something new?”

That curiosity evolved into a global exploration tool that visualizes how *data, creativity, and AI* can collide to tell new stories about our world.
